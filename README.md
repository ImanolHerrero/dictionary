# 📙 Dictionary App

The primary goal of this project was to strengthen my experience in using React and Next.js, managing API calls, styling with Tailwind CSS, and incorporating components from a framework like shadcn/ui.

 ► **[Live demo]()**

#  🌎 API

You can see the API Im using [here](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). 

# ✨ Usage

Upon the initial page load, an example is displayed to guide users on what to expect when searching for a word. Users can then enter a word in the input field, and the information from the API will be presented.

# 💻 Tech Stack
